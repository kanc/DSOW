MeshMaker - Modeling & Editing Collection.
v1.9.2 - Released 31/03/2015 by Alan Baylis
----------------------------------------


Foreword
----------------------------------------
Thank you for your purchase of MeshMaker. This package contains a collection of nine utilities for creating and working with meshes within Unity.

Geom 2.0 - Quick and easy geometric modeling
Mesh Editor - Advanced mesh editing utility
Isosurface - Mathematics inspired meshes
Boolean Ops - Perform CSG operations on meshes
MeshPainter - Paint directly on meshes
Blenderizer - Object focused editor camera
Metaballs - Create new organic base meshes
Mesh Tools - Eleven editing tools in one
Sculptor - Solids of Revolution


Notes
----------------------------------------
The main menu now pops up on the scene view window and hides itself in the bottom left corner when not in use. To show the menu simply place the mouse over the visible title.

You can open up all of the programs at the same time and use them in combination, though this has not been thoroughly tested in all cases. If you have any problems try restarting MeshMaker or Unity to see if that fixes the problem.
  
Geom:
Duplicates of grids made in the hierarchy will not be automatically added to Geom.
Don't delete the Framework or the Grids from the hierarchy, use Geom to delete grids or use the Exit button to end the build session.
Renaming the Grids in the hierarchy will not change their names within Geom.

MeshEditor:
If you are experiencing problems selecting vertices/triangles you can now change the epsilon value by going into edit mode and pressing the divide and multiply keys on the keypad.

When extruding multiple triangles that meet at a single point they sometimes have inverted faces. The solution is to extrude the triangles individually.

Metaballs:
This is an early version of the program and is suitable for working with up to a dozen or so quality metaballs but more if you work in a lower resolution. Ideal for creating a base mesh that can be tweaked with the Mesh Editor program.

Boolean Ops:
It is not recommended to do more that a few operations on the same target object or the geometry may become corrupt. While the program works well on simple objects it may fail on very complicated objects or objects with underlying problems like holes in their geometry. It is highly recommended that you make a copy of the target object and save your scene before using this software.


Todo List
----------------------------------------
Geom:
Done - Improved normal smoothing.
Done - More CPU friendly.
Export to FBX.
Done - Spline based frameworks.
Add holes to mesh design 

MeshEditor:
Done - Extrusion and deformation of meshes.
Edge loops.

MeshPainter:
Done - Direct painting of meshes in Scene View window.
Better painting across triangle edges.
Different brushes.
Fill option.

Boolean Ops:
Mesh optimization to remove excess triangles after each operation.
Option to group triangles that share the same materials.
Recalculate bounding boxes and other obvious fixes.

MeshTools:
Done - Mesh Tools work with submeshes.
Done - More advanced UV Mapping.
Split with plane, with fill option.

Metaballs:
Option to use different formulas for calculating the metaball fields.
Finite support formula.
Auto resizing of the dimensions.
Process only the cubes around the mesh surface and other optimizations.

Sculptor:
Partial revolutions.
Choice of degree to rotate between 0 and 360.
Cap ends.

Mesh Editor uses a cut down version of the undo/redo framework written by Nims72. Very nice code and highly recommended. (https://github.com/Nims72/Unity-Custom-Undo-Redo-System)
